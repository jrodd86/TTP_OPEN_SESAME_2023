  <p><b>Its not a bird, though feathered, and it has a mobile nest. Its quick in flight and, having flown, it always stops to rest. What am I? &#129718;</b></p>
  <input type="text" />

  <p><b>I am nocturnal and fly without a sound,With feathers so soft, I barely make a bound.My eyes are wide and filled with wisdom rare,I hunt in silence, catching prey with care.What am I? &#129417;</b></p>
  <input type="text" />

  <p><b>I have no voice, but I can be heard.I am often raised, but never stirred.People seek me when they have a question to ask,In classrooms, meetings, or any gathering task. What am I? &#9995;</b></p>
  <input type="text" />
    
  <p><b> Long and slithering, I glide through the grass,
With a forked tongue, I detect prey as I pass.
Some fear my venom, others seek my skin,
Legless and sleek, a creature of sin. What am I? &#128013;</b></p>
