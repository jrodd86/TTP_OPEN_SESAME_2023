You are an IT consultant for a group of **good**, Robinhood-esque, white hat hackers. You are tasked with building a security system for them. Using HTML form tags, build a series of questions and checks that the user must answer correctly in order to gain access to the group's database.

Use your imagination! You can include: riddles, trivia, math questions, multiple choice questions, color blind tests, keyfile upload tests, puzzles, etc.

- Place one question / test per html page
- Include at least 5 html pages
- Use at least 5 different input tags, including textarea and select
- Remember to use the form tag, submit button, and action attribute
  - The action attribute should point to the next page

Note: for now, there is no way to check if the user has entered the correct answer. You can just assume that they get it correct.

Don't forget that you can use the APIs!
